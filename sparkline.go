 *
 * A sparkline is a very small line chart, typically drawn without axes or
 * coordinates. It presents the general shape of the variation (typically over
 * time) in some measurement, such as temperature or stock market price, in a
 * simple and highly condensed way. Sparklines are small enough to be embedded
 * in text, or several sparklines may be grouped together as elements of a small
 * multiple.
 *
 * Whereas the typical chart is designed to show as much data as possible, and
 * is set off from the flow of text, sparklines are intended to be succinct,
 * memorable, and located where they are discussed.
 *
 * Sparklines are frequently used in line with text. For example: The Dow Jones
 * Industrial Average for February 7, 2006 sparkline which illustrates the
 * fluctuations in the Down Jones index on February 7, 2006. The sparkline
 * should be about the same height as the text around it. Tufte offers some
 * useful design principles for the sizing of sparklines to maximize their
 * readability.
